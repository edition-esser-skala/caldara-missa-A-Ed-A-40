  – & – & \B1 has been presumably copied by Johann George Kremmler;Johann David Heinichen added notes and emendations. Notably, trb2 has been relabeled as tenor viola. trb 1 has been cancelled and replaced by a vla part. tr 1 and and 2 have been cancelled. Here, the original scoring is used, since it most likely represents Caldara’s original composition. \\
  – & trb & There are minor differences between the trb parts in \B1 and \B2:
      trb 1: Kyrie (20, 33f), Gloria (4, 21f, 26, 40f, 125–130), Credo (9, 33–35, 40)
      trb 2: Kyrie (20, 43), Gloria (26, 100–120)
